# ðŸ§  Questionnaire NLP Validator

A FastAPI-based backend service that uses Basic NLP Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Domain Knowledge to validate and analyze free-text responses from financial questionnaires. It automates the review process for fields like `source_of_funds_description` and `accreditation_details`, returning clear decisions: **Approve**, **Return**, or **Escalate**.
